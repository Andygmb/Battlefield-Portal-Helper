# Using the extension

1. Select a block in your rule editor
2. Click "copy" in the extension - this will fill up the text box with the block's XML
3. Go to any other rule editor window and click "Paste" to paste your blocks in

**You can also copy in XML from other people who have shared it on discord or community sites - just paste it into the text box and click "paste"!**

# Sharing your Blocks

Made a useful Block that others would benefit from? I've opened up a repo at https://github.com/Andygmb/Battlefield-Portal-Blocks that will accept Blocks - just open a PR!

# Todo/features planning
